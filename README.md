# Eye on the Storm: A Journey Through Storm Trajectories
## Overview
This project explores the paths and intensities of major storms in the Atlantic using a combination of static and interactive visualizations. By leveraging R packages like **mapview()**, dynamic maps were created to visualize storm tracks, colored by attributes like *year* and *wind speed*. The interactive plots not only allow users to explore storm paths geographically but also identify individual storms by clicking on their tracks. The 6 storms analyzed in this project are: **Sandy**, **Irma**, **Andrew**, **Maria**, **Harvey**, and **Katrina**.

## Why It Matters:
Understanding storm intensity and movement is critical as climate change continues to influence weather patterns. Visualizing storm data helps researchers and the public grasp how recent storms have behaved and why some have had major impacts.
